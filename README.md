- 👋 Hi, I’m @JazzyTeapot
- 👀 I’m interested in opera singing, coffee, and cats.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the absolute basics! I'm following The Odin Project currently and I am working my way through the foundations course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small scale projects in the future once I feel ready.
